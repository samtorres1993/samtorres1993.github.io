    <p style="color:lightgray;">I chose this cause because although statistically most races smoke similar amounts of marijuana blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be arrested than their white counterparts.</p> 
    <p style="color:lightgray;">I believe that legalizing marijuana will reduce the amount of minorities being unfairly arrested and sentenced with drug charges.</p>
    <p style="color:lightgray;">For my poster I used Photoshop to posterize the hands and the leaf at the center and I used Illustrator to vectorize both images, as well as add the black background, text, and create my logo.</p>
